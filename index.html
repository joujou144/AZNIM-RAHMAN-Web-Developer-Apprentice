          Hi, I'm Aznim. I'm a self-taught web developer with a keen eye for UI effects. I <em>love </em> CSS, my recently-developed super skill. I wake up everyday just to create something intuitive and dynamic with it. Expressive and resilient, I am a problem-solver who is always looking to create great user interfaces, writing solid code and takes pride in building best-in-class solutions. 
        </p>
        <p class="small-text greeting-small">
          My career-change journey from the medical device industry to web development began more out of necessity than raw ambition. As someone who has a tremendous ability to cope with adversity, I have a knack for turning dead ends into open roads. Hard skills can be taught but personality is inherent. I genuinely believe the secret to our goals lies solely in our tenacity.
          <br>
          <br>
          Anything worth achieving is almost always difficult in the beginning as it requires willpower, effort and motivation. Self-discipline and my abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of cultivating skills in a complex discipline of programming whilst raising my child single-handedly has made a powerhouse multitasker who strives for nothing short of excellence in whatever challenge I may be presented with.
