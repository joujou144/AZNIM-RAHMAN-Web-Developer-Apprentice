              Hi, I'm Aznim. I'm a self-taught web developer apprentice with an eye for UI effects. I <em>love </em> CSS, my recently-developed super skill. I wake up everyday just to create something intuitive and dynamic with it. I am an ultimate risk-taker who is expressive, resilient, instinctual and always looking for best design practices. 
            </p>
            <p class="small-text">
              My career-change journey from the medical device industry to web development began more out of necessity than raw ambition. As someone who deeply believes in herself and has a tremendous ability to cope with adversity, I have a knack for turning dead ends into open roads. Hard skills can be taught but personality is inherent. 
              <br>
              <br>
              As I collided dissimilar universes; sparking ideas and crossing off possibilities of what I wanted to do, finally I discovered something that was totally me. Something radically different - that requires mastery in design which helps convey my creativity skills whilst embracing the functionality of tech at the same time. I genuinely believe anything worth achieving is almost always difficult in the beginning and for this reason, I find peace and comfort in being uncomfortable as it is the prime impetus as how I thrive and flourish.
